# JPACRUDProject
## Overview

This project is a full CRUD application which leverages the SpringBoot framework to efficiently utilize JPA in order to produce dynamic web pages. Data for these web pages is persisted, retrieved, updated, and deleted on a local tomcat server running mysql. Specifically the aim of this project is to create a space to catalog information about ski mountains. Additionally to displaying facts about the mountain, the application allows users to persisted their personal experience upon visiting various mountains.

## Technologies Used
* Springboot
* JPA
* mysql
* HTML
* CSS
* JSP

## What I learned and next steps
I learned some of the many ins and outs of integrating SpringBoot and JPA together to produce functional clean code. I look forward to expanding my knowledge of spring annotations and the environment they provide. Going forward with this project I hope to increase the size and variety of data types stored, retrieved, updated, and removed. Additionally I look forward to cleaning up the rougher edges of the current display, and fully implementing the personal accounts one can store in through this application.
